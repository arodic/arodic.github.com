### New Website! ###

Last few months I have been busy working on [io](https://github.com/arodic/io) and [three-ui](https://github.com/arodic/three-ui). Today, I finally got around to updating my website.

This is mostly a technical update but I also added some new projects to the archive and information about my current work.

Since the [Polymer](https://github.com/polymer) library which I used to build my previous website is now deprecated, I built this new website with the latest version of [io](https://github.com/arodic/io), inspired by Polymer and powered by the latest web standards. I hope this will be a good testcase for the designs and ideas I've developed so far.

This is a work in progress, so I apologize for possible hiccups and browser compatibility issues.

**For web developers:**

This entire website is a very simple single page application built with [io](https://github.com/arodic/io). The content is authored in markdown and it is precached to ensure fast page transitions. Feel free to check out the [source code](https://github.com/arodic/arodic.github.com) and suggest improvements.
