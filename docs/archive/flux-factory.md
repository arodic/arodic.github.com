In September 2014 I joined <a href="https://flux.io/" target="_blank">Flux Factory</a> as a front-end software engineer specializing in <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/" target="_blank">WebGL</a> and <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">Polymer</a>.

The goal of the team was to create technology that improves the way buildings are designed and built. My role was to continuously improve our tools, user interface and rendering capabilities of the platform.
