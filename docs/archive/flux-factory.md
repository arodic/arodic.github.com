In September 2014 I joined Flux Factory (now <a href="https://helix.re/" target="_blank">Helix</a>) as a front-end software engineer specializing in WebGL and front-end development.

The goal of the company was to create technology that improves the way buildings are designed and built. My role was to continuously improve our tools, user interface and rendering capabilities of the platform.
