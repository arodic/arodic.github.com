### Google Zeitgeist 2013</h2>

<img style="width:100%;" sizing="cover" src="./images/project/google-zeitgeist-2013.webp" />

Towards the end of each year, Google creates a website to highlight the search trends of the year. In 2013 I took the role of technical lead in creating an interactive data visualization for the search data.

This was a project on an extremely short deadline and mobile support was one its main requirements.
