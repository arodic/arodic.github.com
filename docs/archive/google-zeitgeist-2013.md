### Google Zeitgeist 2013</h2>

<img style="width:100%;" sizing="cover" src="./images/project/google-zeitgeist-2013.jpg" />

Towards the end of each year, Google creates a website to highlight the search trends of the year. In 2013 I took the role of technical lead in creating an interactive data visualization using <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/" target="_blank">WebGL</a> and <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/" target="_blank">Polymer</a>.

This was a project on an extremely short deadline and mobile support was one its main requirements.

You can <a href="https://zeitgeist-globe.appspot.com" target="_blank">see the final product here</a>.
