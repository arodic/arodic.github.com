<img style="width:100%;" sizing="cover" src="./images/project/webgl-jellyfish.jpg" />

<a href="http://akirodic.com/p/jellyfish/" target="_blank">Chrysaora</a> (WebGL Jellyfish) is one of my first WebGL projects originally commissioned by SCAD as a multi-screen video installation in Hong Kong.

This project was my first venture into real-time 3D graphics and one of the first WebGL demos on the web.
