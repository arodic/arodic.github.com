### WebGL Jellyfish

<img style="width:100%;" sizing="cover" src="./images/project/webgl-jellyfish.jpg" />

<a href="http://akirodic.com/p/jellyfish/" target="_blank">Chrysaora</a> (WebGL Jellyfish) was my first WebGL project originally commissioned by Savannah College of Art and Design as a multi-screen video installation in Hong Kong.

This project was my very first venture into real-time 3D graphics and one of the first WebGL demos on the web.

One of the biggest challenges (apart from learning WebGL) was to make the simulation appear seamless across 4 projection screens. This was achieved by synchronizing partial simulation state and parameters using WebSockets.
