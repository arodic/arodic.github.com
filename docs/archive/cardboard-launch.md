Few weeks before the Google I/O 2014 conference we were approached by the Google Cardboard team to create a mobile VR experience using <a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/" target="_blank">WebGL</a>.
This was the very first attempt to create such experience for cardboard.
You can <a href="https://vr.chromeexperiments.com" target="_blank">see the VR experiment here</a>.
