### Hello!

My name is Aleksandar Aki RodiÄ‡ and this website is a presentation platform for my past, current and future work.

I use computer graphics and the art of programming to create innovative digital tools and experiences.

My life took me around the world to study and work in various industries such as web, animation, visual effects, games, architecture, virtual reality and data visualization.

I studied electrical engineering, visual effects and game development and I worked at companies such as EA Games, Pixar, LucasArts and Google. Currently, I do consulting work as a digital nomad but I tend to spend most of my time in Places such as Belgrade, Amsterdam and San Francisco.
