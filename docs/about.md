### Hello!

My name is Aleksandar Aki RodiÄ‡. This is a showcase of my recent work.

**About me**

I use computer graphics and the art of programming to create innovative digital tools and experiences.

For more than a decade, I moved around the world while working in various industries such as web, animation, visual effects, games, architecture, virtual reality and data visualization. I studied electrical engineering, visual effects and game development and I worked at companies such as EA Games, Pixar, LucasArts and Google. Currently, I do consulting work as a digital nomad but I tend to spend most of my time in Belgrade, Amsterdam and San Francisco.
