## Hello

My name is Aki RodiÄ‡. This is my online portfolio.

I use computer graphics and the art of programming to create digital tools and experiences.

Since 2008, I worked in various digital media industries such as web, 3D animation, visual effects, games, architecture, virtual reality and data visualization. I studied electrical engineering, visual effects and game development and I worked at companies such as EA Games, Pixar, LucasArts, Google and most recently Adobe. Currently, I do consulting work specializing in 3D tools and experiences for the web.
