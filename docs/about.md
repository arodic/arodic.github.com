My name is Aki RodiÄ‡. This is my online portfolio.

I use computer graphics and the art of programming to create digital tools and experiences.

For many years, I worked in various industries such as web, animation, visual effects, games, architecture, virtual reality and data visualization. I studied electrical engineering, visual effects and game development and I worked at companies such as EA Games, Pixar, LucasArts and Google. Currently, I do consulting work as a digital nomad.
